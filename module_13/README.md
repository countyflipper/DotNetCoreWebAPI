# Common API Techniques
## Description
In this module you learn to improve your API by implementing action filters, paging, filtering, searching, and sorting. Paging, filtering, searching, and sorting will help to make your API more functional, while action filters to support model validation will reduce code duplication and make your API more maintainable.

## Hands On
Implement action filters to validate your POST, PUT, and PATCH requests, so that invalid models throw exceptions that can be handled by your global error handler.  Then implement paging records, filtering section enrollments by role, and searching for course titles, usernames, emails, on management services that use those fields.  Finally, add sorting functionality to any of the exposed fields contained in a service.
