# Database Model with the Service Repository Pattern
## Description
In this module you learn to use Entity Framework to manage your database structure, seed data, and implement two design patterns that will reduce the duplication of code in your application, so that your application is more maintainable.
## Topics
*   Creating Models
*   Creating Migrations and Seeds
*   Context Class and the Database Connection
*   Migration and Initial Data Seed
*   Repository Pattern Logic
*   Repository User Interfaces and Classes
*   Creating a Repository Manager 
## Hands On
Create a service for each management function of the system and create the required models, repositories, and repository manager functionality.  Create seed data and migrations using EF Core that represent your schools test data.  You will need to research how to make more complex relationships in your database model with entity framework.  I intentionally require you to research this because you need to spend time with the documentation and learning Entity Frameowrk in detail.
