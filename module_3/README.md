# How to Design a REST API Web API
## Description
In this module you learn REST API terminology, the HTTP protocol and how to design an API using the Open API Specification (Swagger).  You will apply these concepts to develop documentation for your API that will be needed to guide the development of the project as you work through the course.
## Topics
- HTTP
- Message Formats (XML and JSON)
- Open API Spec

## Hands-On
Create an Openm API Design Document using the Swagger Editor for Open API 3.0.  This spec will describe the REST API functionality that you need to expose your school database design as a REST API.  Include HTTP request methods and response codes.  You also need to create a definition of HTTP response codes for errors such as 404 Not Found and other common response codes that are sent when something goes wrong.
#### Please upload the API design document that you create to the learning management system.
