# How to Design a REST API Web API
## Description
In this module you learn REST API terminology, the HTTP protocol, and how to design an API.  You will apply these concepts to develop documentation for your API that will be needed to guide the development of the project as you work through the course.
## Topics
- HTTP
- XML
- JSON
- API Versioning
## Hands-On
Create an API design document that describes each HTTP request that our school API will require to support the business requirements and supported by the database schema previously created.  Include HTTP request methods and response codes.  You also need to create a definition of HTTP response codes for errors such as 404 Not Found and other common response codes that are sent when something goes wrong.
